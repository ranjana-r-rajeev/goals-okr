                    Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a popular framework used to set and track goals in many organizations. While the specific terms and conditions for OKRs may vary depending on the organization, here are some general guidelines:<br/>

                    1. Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).<br/>

                    2. Key Results should be quantifiable and have a clear target that can be objectively measured.<br/>

                    3. Objectives and Key Results should be aligned with the overall mission and vision of the organization.<br/>

                    4. Objectives and Key Results should be reviewed regularly and adjusted as needed to ensure progress is being made. <br/>

                    5. Confidential information should not be included in objectives or key results.<br/>

                    6. Objectives and Key Results should be challenging but achievable, and employees should be provided with the necessary resources and support to meet them.<br/>

                    7. Objectives and Key Results should be transparent and visible to all relevant stakeholders.<br/>

                    8. Employees should be held accountable for meeting their objectives and key results, and performance should be evaluated based on progress made toward these goals.<br/>

                    9. Objectives and Key Results should not be used as the sole determinant of compensation or promotion decisions.<br/>

                    10. The organization may modify or terminate the use of OKRs at any time, at its sole discretion.<br/>

                    It's important to note that these are general guidelines, and organizations may have specific terms and conditions for OKRs that align with their unique culture, values, and goals.
